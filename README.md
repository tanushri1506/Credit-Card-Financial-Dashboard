# Credit Card Financial Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project consists of two interactive Power BI dashboards built on provided datasets to analyze customer behavior and credit card financial performance. Together, these dashboards offer a comprehensive view of transactions, revenue, customer demographics, and risk metrics, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

The solution integrates two datasets — customer details and credit card transaction data — and uses interactive slicers for dynamic exploration of insights.

## Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive weekly credit card dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

## Data Description
The dashboard is built using two datasets sourced from SQL:

- **Customer Dataset:** Customer demographics (gender, location), card category, and activation details  
- **Credit Card Transaction Dataset:** Transaction amount and count, revenue and interest, weekly and yearly performance metrics  

## Data Processing & Modeling
1. Imported data from SQL into Power BI  
2. Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query  
3. Established relationships between customer and transaction tables  
4. Created calculated measures using DAX for KPIs such as:
   - Total Revenue  
   - Total Transaction Amount & Count  
   - Interest Earned  
   - Activation Rate  
   - Delinquency Rate  
   - Week-over-Week (WoW) changes  

## Dashboards Overview
The project includes the following two dashboards:

### 1. Credit Card Transaction Dashboard
- Tracks weekly and YTD revenue, transaction amount, and transaction count  
- Monitors interest earned and overall financial performance  
- Analyzes card category contribution (Blue, Silver, etc.)  
- Identifies top-performing states and regions  

### 2. Customer & Risk Insights Dashboard
- Analyzes customer demographics (gender, location)  
- Tracks activation and delinquency rates  
- Evaluates customer contribution to revenue  
- Highlights behavioral and risk-related trends  

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive slicers for:
  - Time period (Week / YTD)  
  - Gender  
  - Card category  
  - Location (State)  
- KPI cards for quick performance overview  
- Clear separation of financial performance and customer/risk insights  

## Key Insights (Sample)
- Overall revenue reached **55M YTD**  
- Total transaction amount of **45M** with **8M interest earned**  
- Male customers contributed higher revenue compared to female customers  
- Blue and Silver credit cards accounted for **~93% of total transactions**  
- TX, NY, and CA contributed **~68% of total revenue**  
- Overall activation rate: **57.5%**  
- Overall delinquency rate: **6.06%**
